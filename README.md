# Tomasulo-Algorithm-Simulation
This project simulates the Tomasulo algorithm, an out-of-order execution algorithm used in computer architecture. The simulation focuses on implementing the basic components of Tomasulo's algorithm, including reservation stations, functional units, and register result forwarding. The system also supports branch prediction.
